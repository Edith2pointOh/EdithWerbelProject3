** Firstly many thanks for leading me through this journey.

This progject is embaressingly incomplete, and rather idiotic. But I wanted to hand something in.

It course was very challenging -- in big part due to a concussion I'm suffering from right now. I'm brain fog central.

I'm very dedicated to really finishing this project in my own time. I will refactor it and make it better
and not embaressing. And actually helpful. I've learnt so much during this course and I will not let it slide. 

Thank you again. x edith.
